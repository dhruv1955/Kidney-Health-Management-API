# Hospital-HTTP
->Developed a RESTful API using Express.js to manage user data and kidney health status.

->Implemented CRUD operations:

->GET: Retrieve the number of healthy and unhealthy kidneys for a user.
->POST: Add a new kidney with its health status.
->PUT: Update all kidneys to healthy status.
->DELETE: Remove all unhealthy kidneys, with error handling for cases where no unhealthy kidneys exist.
->Utilized middleware to parse JSON data from incoming requests.

->Designed and managed data structures using JavaScript arrays and objects.

->Handled error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

->Tested and validated API endpoints to ensure correct functionality.
